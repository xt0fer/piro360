Piro360
Piro360 is a mobile app that lets a user tap a button in the app, and then the user has 10 seconds to pirouette 360 degrees in a circle holding 
their phone and pointing outward capturing a panorama recording. 
The app starts the video camera and records for 10 seconds, as the user pirouettes, it records where the user is. When the recording is finished 
the user can tag the video with tags, and then is given the option to post it to the piro360.com website for the world to see.

So if you’re someplace cool, and you want to show your friends, do a Piro360!

Imagine standing at the top of the Empire State Building and pirouetting around to show your friends the view. Or in the middle of a busy souk in Tangiers, 
or a tropical beach, or in the lobby of a fancy hotel. Show your friends the world around you.

Piro360s will become the new new thing in social media.

My MVP will allow a user to record the 10sec video and auto upload it to a simple blog-like site which will show the latest 15 Piro360s.

I’ll do it using Spring, Java, SQL DB, Heroku and a Angular front end app.
